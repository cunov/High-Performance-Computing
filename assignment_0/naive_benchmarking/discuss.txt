O0 is default (no optimization, fastest compile)		3553284.500000 micro seconds
O1 is optimize (longer compilation, more memory)		1108369.000000 micro seconds
O2 is optimize more (+compilation, +performance)		1121769.700000 micro seconds
O3 is optimize even more					1145410.500000 micro seconds 
Os is optimize for size (bytes of code and data)		2522330.700000 micro seconds
Og is optimize for debugging					2576853.700000 micro seconds

idk what else was running on cpu at the time of these, and i only did 10 iterations (didn't check that that yielded consistent averages)
