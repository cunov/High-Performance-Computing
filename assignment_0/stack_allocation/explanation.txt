Segmentation fault at size = 10M. A seg fault is thrown when the program tries to access "out of bounds" memory.

The stack size in bytes is:
[hpcuser026@gantenbein stack_allocation]$ ulimit -s
8192

I then re-ran it with a size of 2,093,973 which uses 8179 megabytes, that worked. Inc'ing the size by 1 yielded a failure.
In this case, we exceeded the size of the stack.
